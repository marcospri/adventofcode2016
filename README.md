# Solutions for advent of code (2016) in Elm

Solutions for Advent of Code (http://adventofcode.com/2016) in Elixir (http://elm-lang.org/)

Solved the first 6 problems so far. I did last year's problems on Elixir and haven't done any functional programing since. 

Elm being a front end language compiling to JavaScript I felt forced to do some web dashboard even if it's completely 
useless and possibly the only non-SPA ever written in a trendy language.

Elm is great although I have to admit I'm not taking advantage of the type safety it provides as much as I should 
(ie I use Debug.crash a lot instead of properly handle parsing errors in the inputs).

As for the problems themselves they are fun as last year's and my solutions also as naive and brute-forcy as last year's.
